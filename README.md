# 2017network-rankings
Project on how networked science can produce rankings that are actually worthwhile in evaluating scholars using social network analysis.

With this fork, I aim to focus on the soft side of networked rankings in scientific communication using the concept of meta-organization (Gulati, Puranam, & Tushman, 2012, Strategic Management Journal).
Meta-organizations are "networks of firms or individuals not bound by authority based on employment relationships, but characterized by a system-level goal" (p. 573).
